# Undying Mage

## Description

A mage that respawns over and over; getting stronger with each revive, thus making him the undying mage as the mage never really dies permanently, he always comes back for more.

The goal in this game is just to try to survive as long as you can. Each death makes you more powerful as every time you die, you get access to the upgrade menu where you can power up your stats.

Hence, the theme: "Death is only the beginning". The first death is your first access to the upgrade
menu where you can power up your stats and every death just makes you more powerful.

A game for the 2022 GameDev.tv game jam in itch.io.
